Movico is a language based on Model, Controller and View approach.  In
this  approach  a model  denotes  a set  of  data  (atomic or  object)
federated in  a named  structure. A controller  is a set  of behaviors
applied to a  given object and finally a view  denotes an extended DOM
fragment used for UI management.

Movico is a  strong typed language based on  well known Hindley-Milner
type system and type inference paradigm.
